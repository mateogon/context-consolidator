## How It Works  

### üìÇ File & Folder Consolidation  

1. **Select Files/Folders:**  
   - **Right-click a Folder:** Choose **"Add to consolidated list"** to include all its files.  
   - **Select Individual Files:** Right-click a file and add it to your list.  

2. **Manage Your List:**  
   - See **"Files to consolidate (n)"** in the status bar.  
   - Click the status bar to open the consolidation menu and remove unwanted files.  

3. **Consolidate with One Click:**  
   - Click **"Consolidate All"** in the menu to copy the full XML-formatted snapshot to your clipboard.  

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Snippet Consolidation  

1. **Highlight a Code Snippet:**  
   - Select any block of code and right-click **"Add Selection to Consolidate List."**  
   - The snippet is now tracked separately, along with its file name and line numbers.  

2. **Automatic Snippet Tracking:**  
   - If you edit your document, the snippet range adjusts dynamically.  
   - Insert lines above, inside, or around it‚Äîyour selection stays accurate.  

3. **Consolidate Updated Snippets:**  
   - When you consolidate, snippets reflect their latest state in the document.  
   - They appear alongside full files in the XML snapshot, preserving their position.  

### XML Structure Example  

```xml
<ConsolidatedFilesContext>
  <FolderTree>
    path/to/file1.ts
  </FolderTree>
  <Code file="path/to/file1.ts">
    // Full file content...
  </Code>
  <Code file="path/to/file1.ts" snippet="lines 10-15">
    // Snippet content...
  </Code>
</ConsolidatedFilesContext>
```
